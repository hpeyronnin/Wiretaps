    "Under Title III of The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and 18 U.S.C. § 2519, The Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO) is required to publish annual federal and state __[records](https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/analysis-reports/wiretap-reports)__ of interception orders for wire, oral, or electronic communications. For each intercept, the AO's annual report includes information on the total cost and duration, the offense under investigation, the jurisdiction, and other data. The full set of variables is listed below.\n",

    "These data reveal important information about the use of surveillance in criminal investigations. Where are wiretaps used most, and for what types of crimes are they most often deployed? How do wiretap characteristics vary by crime, geography, and over time? What underlying changes in technology, policy, or society might explain these trends? Analyzing wiretap records also allow us to gauge their efficacy of as an investigative tool. How often do wiretaps result in arrests or convictions? Do their benefits outweight their costs? The overarching objective of this report is to answer some of these questions. \n",

    "\n",
    "The breakup of AT&T in 1982 and Bell Systems later that decade led to a period of renewed competition, growth, and innovation in the telecommunications industry. As the number of telecommunications companies proliferated and new technologies flooded the market, the FBI struggled to keep pace with these new source of complexity. Worried about how this would affect their ability to conduct surveillance, the FBI pursued legislation in Congress that would protect its wiretapping abilities from the effect of potentially disruptive technologies. The FBI's argument in favor of legislative protection rested on a key unstated assumption: that wiretaps are indeed vital tools for law enforcement. Is this assumption indeed valid? \n",
    "\n",
    "In _Privacy on the Line_, Susan Landau and Whitfield Diffie (2010) attempt to find out by digging into the data on wiretaps. They draw mostly on records from 1988 to 1994, but also include data from 1968 to 2006. Their analysis yields insights into the efficacy of wiretaps as well as other aspects of their usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "When federal wiretap regulation went into effect in 1968, the majority of wiretaps (64%) were used for investigating gambling cases. Since then, however, the share of wiretaps devoted to narcotics investigations has steadily increased. In 1994, narcotics investigations accounted for 77% of all cases using electronic surveillance. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the use of electronic surveillance increasingly became concentrated on narcotics investigations, the average wiretap became longer and more costly. Between 1968 and 1994, the average cost of a wiretap rose from 1,358 to 49,478 dollars, and the length doubled from 20 to nearly 40 days (209). This shift was largely due to the lengthy timelines involved in drug investigations, which can span months or years. Although wiretaps occasionally result in large drug busts, it is unlikely that they actually affect the underlying problem of consumption, or that they are a better use of funds than alternative methods of stemming drug use (211).\n",
    "\n",
    "In making the case for wiretapping, the FBI has cited their importance in investigations of kidnapping and domestic terrorism. Between 1968 and 1994, however, electronic surveillance only played a role in just 2-3 kidnapping cases per year, and domestic terrorism cases are more likely to be investigated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (211).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the state level, 48 jurisdictions have laws that permit that authorize courts to issue orders for oral, wire, or electronic surveillance (AO, 2017). In 2017, the states with the most wiretaps were California, New York, Nevada, California, and North Carolina. Since the 1990s, California has seen a massive increase in wiretaps: from 8 in 1994 to 225 in 2017 (212; AO, 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the trends first observed by Landau and Diffie continued apace in the early aughts, but two major changes in wiretapping have occured since the 1990s. First, portable devices became the most commonly wiretapped devices. Because portable devices have increased the number of daily communications, the first change begot a second: the government began intercepting ever-greater volumes of communications. The number of intercepted conversations has increased from around 400,000 in 1968 to over 2 million (214-215).\n",
    "\n",
    "Landau and Diffie note several limitations in the _Wiretap Report_ data. First, its statistics do not distinguish wiretaps from bugs. Second, due to reporting issues the data may actually underestimate the total number of intercepts installed. Third, the data lack important contextual information from the court hearings themselves."
